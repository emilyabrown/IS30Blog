# Week 4 Blog Post

## This week, the reading that spoke to me most was...

*This week, the reading that spoke to me most was...the Lievrouw reading, particularly the section regarding Wikipedia. I remember all throughout elementary and middle school, my teachers would refuse to let us use Wikipedia. Reading this paper allowed me to reconsider the value of collective knowledge.* 

*Liewvrouw essentially discussed what constitutes as legitimate knowledge. Wikipedia’s growth and popularity as reference for many topics also came with questions regarding its quality, credibility, and accuracy. Liewrouw stated Wikipedia’s intrinsic paradox: reliable information resource made without any reliance on professional experts.*

*Interestingly, just like the internet itself, Wikipedia was originally intended to supplement another database, Nupedia. It immediately got volunteer contributions. While early Wikipedia was part older sources and part contributor knowledge, today it relies solely on its contributors. English Wikipedia because very popular early on, in the early 2000s. By 2010, ⅘ of Wikipedia posts are in languages other than English. Interestingly, a small minority of people continue to contribute the most posts.*

*As Wikipedia grew, questions regarding its reliability forced its community into two groups. Inclusionists championed a hands off approach. Deletionists preferred to guide posts and fact-check with clear user guidelines, which is what became the Wikipedia we know today. The rules and guidelines have accumulated over time as more and more content has been created. Inclusionists think all the guidelines are limiting creativity and will cause “instruction creep: when rules increase and number and size until they are unmanageable”. Deletionists, on the other hand, think guidelines are necessary to promote accuracy.*  

*All in all, Wikipedia's success as a front-line information resources is due to several key factors. The collaborative database becomes more valuable as it accumulates more information. Because of the large number of participants and the size of the resources they produce, Wikipedia is a lucrative source of information. However, it has a hidden risk of ‘lock-in’, where the system becomes so big, it prevents other innovations. Wikipedia risks monopolizing the public information platform.  The Wikipedia genre isn’t ‘interventionist’ like other genres; its meant to complement other forms of knowledge. Just like last week's topic however, the growing amount of information is causing Wikipedia's organization to become more complex. Wikipedia's organization isn’t a hierarchy, all of the pages are interlinked. Berners-Lee's organizational 'web' structure concept is easily visible here. While Wikipedia's dynamic quality makes it so accessible, it also makes it unstable; information can disappear in an instant.*
