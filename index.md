## IS30: Week 1 Blog Post

### 	In class, many of us were asked what our first memory of the internet was... 
*...I remember a giant hulking Macintosh perched on a foreboding desktop in my mother’s office. It was so huge, I thought the delicate desk would buckle under its weight. Sitting on multiple phonebooks, I’d play Webkinz on the computer that was bigger than I was. When we began to read about the telegraph, radio, and other early forms of communication that exceeded the limits of physical transportation, I was reminded of the gigantic computer. I remembered thinking how something so inelegant could be responsible for holding and sending all of our important information. I wonder if children in homes that housed this first telegraphs thought the same thing. As I learn more about the nature of information and its relatively recent technological evolution, I consider how they were woven into the ‘common sense’ culture of their societies. The Carey reading does an excellent job of explaining how the telegraph, the pioneering invention in communication as we know it today, set about implementing these changes.*

*Understanding communication reaches far beyond the mechanical explanation of how these machines work and into the cultural impact of their use. Carey decribes how the telegraph implemented three major changes between communication and ideology. In the rise of communication monopolies, formation of a middle-class, and the religious iconographic designation of modern communication technology. I can’t help compare it to its modern day analog, the internet. As I read the passages, making contemporary comparisons came naturally. Facebook and AT&T seemed to be parallel in many ways. As I continued onto the next reading, I began to realize the issue with projecting modern technology onto historical movements. The culture and settings differ immensely between the two, and trying to reconcile them as to analogous experiences is vastly reductionist.* 

*In Wu’s reading, his theory of ‘the Cycle’ outlines an archetypal progression of communication technology across the ages. In a nutshell, a new method of communication inspires a generation with its revolutionary applications. As time progresses, that same generation considers the inevitable faults in the process and in turn invents a new form of communication to address its shortcomings and replace it, initiating the cycle again. As Wu begins to describe the standardization of the early internet with the advent of HTML commands, I considered how the Cycle continues even within the same technology. With new coding languages and cloud-sharing technology, the Cycle continues infinitely within itself. In preventing the monopoly that came with the telegraph, radio, and television, the internet compromised some of the ‘centralized systems…[and] efficiencies” that come with a monopoly. In heated debate that I can only compare to modern Net Neutrality issue, early developers of the internet considered whether or not their technology was more efficient with or without competition.* 
	
*The readings this week gave me a lot of consider about how I interact with the internet. It stands on the shoulders of previous technologies that paved the way mechanically and culturally for the proliferation of the internet in a world where speed is everything.*
