# IS30: Week 2 Blog Post


*In the information management proposal, Berners-Lee first toyed with the idea of organizing shared information in a web. Because of the company's high staff turnover, coding information was lost when an employee left the company. Even if the information was recorded, it was hard to find. The company worked on new projects and new tech usually only affect some employees, so when manipulating their shared system, it was hard to figure out who/what part of CERN will be affected.
Berners-Lee wanted to develop a system of info organization that will evolve with CERN’s projects and staff, and the idea for HTML was born.

*The idea for hypertext came from Ted Nelson, who thought hypertext could make giant amounts of information navigable and interpretable for everyone. Berners-Lee wanted to apply hypertext to his company in the following ways:

*1. Development Project Documentation
  *- Records who did what
  *- What documents exist on a subject
  *- Cross-link to other projects/databases
*2. Document retrieval
  *- Browse through documents and print and/or display it
*3. “Personal Skills Inventory”
  *- Users can be linked to their projects, machines, programming languages, etc.
  
*This article's use of hypertext in the 1990s reminded me of a similar concept in the 1945 Bush paper. After WWII, scientific innovations, healthcare discoveries, weapons advancement, and historical archiving exponentially increased the amount of data available to the public. Bush wanted to have a system in place that allowed a person to scan through vast schemes of information quickly and easily. While Bush called his idea a 'memex', his concept centered on the very same key points as Ted Nelson's.

*What I found so interesting about these two reading materials in particular was the modern hindsight. The ideas in these papers seemed like common sense to me, which is a statement to the efficacy and totality with which these concepts were assimilated into daily life and culture. I realized that there is a lot of history below the surface that I have never considered when it comes to the internet. I always think that it started in the 1980s and didn't really take off until after I was born, but these articles reminded me that the internet is a vast accumulation of ideas and technology across history.
