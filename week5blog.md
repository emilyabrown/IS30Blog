# Week 5 Blog Post

## This week, the topics we focused on largely considered the reinvention of labor in the internet age...

* ...In the SDS Dateline Video, the physical reality of E-waste was brought to light. The internet is largely considered a non-physical entity, so to see the actual remnants of technology past was a wake-up call for me.  The video largely discussed illegal dumping in Ghana. First-world countries continue to take advantage of the same nations that were victim to colonialism by illegally dumping toxic E-waste. To see the physical consequences of technology beyond my sphere of understanding was really impactful, and I'll be thinking a lot more about technical waste. *

* Inequality continues to perpetuate in waste management. The Dateline video articulated negative consequences of unsustainable production, while the Jackson paper discussed the opportunities within 'waste'. The section in shipbreaking really allowed me to reframe how I consider waste and recycling. Jackson's photo of shipbreaking made me think of its inverse, shipbuilding. As a visual person, being able to see what shipbreaking looks like really allowed me to conceptualize what it represents within Jackson's paper. By deconstructing the ship, its materials are given new life and provide new economical support to the community. *
